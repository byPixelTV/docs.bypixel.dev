## When should you use RediVelocity?

RediVelocity is a powerful tool for managing and connecting multiple proxies or interacting with them in your normal Bukkit or Paper plugins. You should use RediVelocity if:

- You want to sync the playercount of your proxies.
- You want to have access to certain events that get fired on the proxy via Redis.
- You want to get insights into your proxies with the builtin commands.

If any of these scenarios apply to you, RediVelocity may be the right choice for your proxy.
