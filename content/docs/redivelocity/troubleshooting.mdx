We can't give you specific solutions without more information about your setup and the issues you're facing. However, we can provide some general troubleshooting steps that may help you resolve common problems.

1. **Check the Logs**: The first step in troubleshooting any issue is to check the logs. RediVelocity provides detailed logs that can help you identify the root cause of the problem. Look for any error messages or warnings that may indicate what went wrong.

2. **Verify Configuration**: Ensure that your RediVelocity configuration is correct. Double-check all settings, including server addresses, ports, and authentication credentials. A misconfiguration is often the cause of connectivity issues.

3. **Test Connectivity**: If you're having trouble connecting to Redis, test the network connectivity between your RediVelocity instance and your Redis server / Cluster.

4. **Update RediVelocity**: Make sure you're using the latest version of RediVelocity. Updates often include bug fixes and improvements that can resolve existing issues.

5. **Update Velocity itself**: Ensure that your Velocity proxy is also up to date. Incompatible versions between RediVelocity and Velocity can lead to unexpected behavior.

6. **Consult the Documentation**: The RediVelocity documentation is a valuable resource for troubleshooting. Refer to the official documentation for guidance on common issues and their solutions.

7. **Seek Community Support**: If you're still having trouble, consider reaching out to the RediVelocity community for help. You can ask questions in the [Discord server](https://discord.gg/yVp7Qvhj9k) or search for similar issues on GitHub.
