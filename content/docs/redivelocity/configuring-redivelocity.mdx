On this page, you will find information about how to configure RediVelocity to suit your needs. We will cover the main configuration options available and provide examples to help you get started. Also, we will explain each configuration option in detail.

## The default configuration

```yaml
config-version: 1

debug-mode: false # enable to log additional debug information to the console

proxy-id:
  id: "proxy-1" # unique id of this proxy instance, must be different for each proxy in the network. will be ignored if auto-generate is true
  auto-generate: true # set to true to auto-generate a random unique id on first startup (recommended)

redis:
  host: "localhost"
  port: 6379
  username: "default" # if you don't know what this is, leave it as "default" or if your Redis server has no username, set to blank
  password: "ver!ySâ‚¬cureP@ssw0rd" # set to blank if no password is required
  database: 0 # if you don't know what this is, leave it at 0

cloud-support:
  enabled: false # this will enable support for cloud systems like CloudNet, SimpleCloud or VulpesCloud. It will replace the proxy-id with the cloud system's server id automatically
  cloud-system: "cloudnet" # can be "cloudnet", "simplecloud" or "vulpescloud"

update-check:
  enabled: true
  notify-admins: true # notify users with the permission "redivelocity.admin.updatecheck" about available updates
  check-interval: 3600 # in seconds

playercount-sync:
  enable: true
  use-backend-server-count: false # if enabled, the global player count will be the sum of players on the specified backend servers instead of the proxies
  backend-server-names: # list of backend server names to include in the player count (only used if use-backend-server-count is true). add an entry contain '*' to include all backend servers. regex is supported
    - "server-1"
    - "server-2"

playerversion-check:
  enabled: true
  allowed-versions:
    - 773

commands: # enable or disable specific commands
  find: true # find players across all proxies and display some information about them
```

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What are the default config options?" id="default-options">

You can get a default config if you just delete the old one and restart your proxy.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What happens if the config version changes?" id="config-version-changes">

RediVelocity will automatically update your config to the new version while keeping your existing settings. It will add new options with their default values and remove deprecated ones.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Where can I customize the messages?" id="customize-messages">

RediVelocity has a separate messages file located at `messages.yml` in the same folder as the main config. You can customize all messages shown to players and admins there.
