On this page, you will find information about how to configure RediVelocity to suit your needs. We will cover the main configuration options available and provide examples to help you get started. Also, we will explain each configuration option in detail.

## The default configuration
This is not exactly the default configuration, but it is a good starting point for most users. You can find the actual default configuration in the `config.yml` file after installing the plugin.

```yaml
# RediVelocity config
# Generated automatically at plugin load

# Internal config version. DO NOT CHANGE! Could already be changed by the time this documentation was written
configVersion: 13
# Debug mode (verbose logging)
debugMode: true

# Json format for some data
jsonFormat: false

# Redis config
redis:
  host: "127.0.0.1"
  port: 6379
  username: "default"
  password: "password"
  cluster: false
  channel: "redivelocity-players"

# Cloud system integration (can be simplecloud, vulpescloud or cloudnet)
cloud:
  enabled: false
  cloudSystem: "cloudnet"

# Playercount sync
playerCountSync: true

# Versioncontrol
versionControl:
  enabled: false
  allowedVersions:
    - 769
    - 768
    - 767
    - 770
  kickMessage: "<red><b>MyNetwork.net</b></red> <grey>-</grey> <color:#ff0000><b>UNSUPORTED VERSION</b></color><br><br><color:#96a7b2>You are using a <color:#ff0000>unsuported version!</color><br>You need version 1.21+ to join <red><b>MyNetwork.net!</b></red>"

# Joingate
joingate:
  allowJavaClients: true
  floodgateHook: false
  allowBedrockClients: false

# Message format
messages:
  prefix: "<dark_grey>[<color:#08a8f8>RediVelocity</color>]</dark_grey>"
```

## What are each configuration options?
### debugMode:
- Enables verbose logging for debugging purposes.
### jsonFormat:
- Enables JSON format for some data, but this is not used currently, and will most likely be removed in the future.
### redis:
- Configuration options for the Redis connection. Should be self-explanatory.
### cloud:
- Configuration options for the cloud system integration. Can be simplecloud, vulpescloud or cloudnet. If you are using a cloud system, make sure to enable this option and configure it accordingly. It will use the name of the server that is provided by the cloud system.
- Also make sure that the plugin provided by the cloud you are using is loaded, CloudNet for example requires the Bridge module to make the RediVelocity integration work.
### playerCountSync:
- Enables player count synchronization between different proxies.
### versionControl:
- Enables version control for the proxy. If enabled, only players with allowed versions can join the server.
### joingate:
- Configuration options for the joining gate. This includes options for allowing Java and Bedrock clients, as well as any necessary hooks for plugins like Floodgate.
### messages:
- Configuration options for the messages sent by the proxy. This includes the prefix used for all messages.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="What are the default config options?" id="default-options">

You can get a default config if you just delete the old one and restart your proxy.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="What happens if the config version changes?" id="config-version-changes">

RediVelocity will try to use your own config and apply the changes made, if this fails it creates a backup in the `config-backup` folder. Depending on how many errors there are during the process, you may need to find the correct file from the created ones.
