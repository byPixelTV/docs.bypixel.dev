First of all, RediVelocity does not have a dedicated API. Instead, it uses Redis Pub/Sub for communication between your plugins or code and the RediVelocity system. This allows for a more dynamic and responsive integration process. You can read more about that here: [Why is there no dedicated API?](why-no-real-api)
This means that you can interact with RediVelocity using any programming language or framework that has a Redis library. You are not limited to Minecraft plugins or the JVM world. This flexibility allows you to create custom integrations and plugins that suit your specific needs.

## What do you need to get started?
To interact with RediVelocity, you will need:

1. A Redis client library for your programming language of choice.
2. Basic knowledge of Redis Pub/Sub concepts, JSON and how to interact with data stored in Redis.
3. Access to a running instance of RediVelocity.

## What can you do with RediVelocity?
With RediVelocity, you can:

1. Kick players from the network by uuid.
2. Receive some information about your proxies with the data stored in Redis.

Currently this is everything you can do, but more features may be added in the future.

## How to kick a player
To kick a player from the network, you need to publish a message to the `redivelocity-kick` channel with the player's UUID and a kick message. Currently, we can't provide actuall code examples, but if you want to add a code example for a specific language, feel free to do so!

### What should I send to the channel?
You should send a JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{
  "uuid": "player-uuid-here",
  "reason": "You have been kicked from the server."
}
```

If you want to colorize the kick message, you have to use the MiniMessage format. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "uuid": "player-uuid-here",
  "reason": "<red>You have been kicked from the server.</red>"
}
```

You can learn more about MiniMessage formatting [here](https://docs.adventure.kyori.net/minimessage/).
